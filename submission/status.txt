TLDR; The game currently runs fully and correctly. 
The text based runs as expected and plays the game as it should.
The GUI based version runs as expected and plays the game as it should.
In the GUI based version when a winner is found the game shows a message that says "PLAYER_COLOR wins!" and a message that says "Press 'R' to reset."
At this point until the user presses 'R' the game is frozen and the user cannot interact with the board.
The user can then press 'R' to reset the game and play again.
